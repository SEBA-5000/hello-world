# hello-world
Hi there, I'm a musician/artisan who loves to build/repair anything I am able to and I believe ideas run the world.
I also very much enjoy helping things grow and understanding plant metabolism through genotypical and phenotypical observation, experimentation and research.(not just the electric lettuce:)
